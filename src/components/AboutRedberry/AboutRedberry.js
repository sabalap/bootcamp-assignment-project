          You watch ‚ÄúWhat? Where? When?‚Äù Yeah. Our founders used to play it.
          That‚Äôs where they got a question about a famous American author and
          screenwriter Ray Bradbury. Albeit, our CEO Gaga Darsalia forgot the
          exact name and he answered Ray Redberry. And at that moment, a name
          for a yet to be born company was inspired - Redberry üòá

          As we said, Redberry has been on the field for quite some time now,
          and we have touched and embraced a variety of programming languages,
          technologies, philosophies, and frameworks. We are battle-tested in
          PHP Laravel Stack with Vue.js, refined in React, and allies with
          Serverside technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, and now we have
          set foot in the web3 industry.

          As this infamous pandemic took over the world, we adjusted our working
          practices so that our employees can be as safe and comfortable as
          possible. We have a hybrid work environment, so you can either work
          from home or visit our lovely office on Sairme Street. If it was up to
          us, we would love you to see us in the office because we think
          face-to-face communications {">"} Zoom meetings. Both on the fun and
          productivity scales.

          We were soo much fun before the pandemic started! Parties almost every
          weekend and lavish employee birthday celebrations! Unfortunately,
          covid ruined that fun like it did almost everything else in the world.
          But we try our best to zhuzh it up a bit. For example, we host
          biweekly Devtalks where our senior and lead developers talk about
          topics they are passionate about. Previous topics have included Web3,
          NFT, Laravel 9, Kubernetes, etc. We hold these talks in the office but
          you can join our Zoom broadcast as well. Feel free to join either as
          an attendee or a speaker!
