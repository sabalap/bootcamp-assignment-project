        You watch “What? Where? When?” Yeah. Our founders used to play it.
        That’s where they got a question about a famous American author and
        screenwriter Ray Bradbury. Albeit, our CEO Gaga Darsalia forgot the
        exact name and he answered Ray Redberry. And at that moment, a name for
        a yet to be born company was inspired - Redberry 😇
